# cat-and-dog-classification

This is an image classification project where the CNN model classifies the images of cats and dogs. The model achieved an accuracy of 95.57%. 

The code is written in python using keras and tensorflow modules with special visualings plots using Tensorboards API.

1. main.ipynb is for training the model and visualisation of parameters.
2. eval.ipynb is for predicting the given image.

You can use best_model.h5 for predicting the class without traning the model.

The complete report and explanation of this project is given in [About.md](https://github.com/sairamkiran9/cat-and-dog-classification/blob/master/About.md)
